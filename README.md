# dbtrack
Track database (data) changes with options to view/revert/export tracked information.

dbtrack can help you track, view and revert database changes (data related - not schema changes). This is particularly helpful during testing or while trying to replicate a bug. Currently supported databases are MySQL and PostgreSQL and it works using triggers and functions to track data changes.
